# smart-rover
Smart Rover is a Mars rover simulation that allows the user to navigate a real location on Mars. We chose the Curiosity Rover landing site from a sattelite photo from  https://trek.nasa.gov/mars, and converted that into a terrain. Currently working is forward and horizontal movement, and camera movement is disabled for now. 

# Run
